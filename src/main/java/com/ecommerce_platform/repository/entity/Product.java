/**
 * Represents a product in the e-commerce catalog.
 * <p>
 *
 * Relationships:
 * - No direct relationships are needed since products are referenced by cart and orders.
 * <p>
 *
 * Annotations:
 * @Entity marks this class as a persistent entity.
 * @Table(name = "products") specifies the table name.
 * <p>
 *
 * Why no relationships?
 * - Products are referenced by other entities like Cart and Order, so they donâ€™t directly manage these associations.
 * - Simplifies management of product data without overloading the entity with relationships.
